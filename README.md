## Introduction
This project aims to predict the property values and rent prices for properties in London using a diverse set of Machine Learning models. Through the use of a large dataset of over 200k records from Kaggle.com, the project includes data cleaning, data analysis, and the creation and comparison of multiple Machine Learning models.

## Notes
The Random Forest model delivered the most accurate predictions for property prices, achieving an R² score of approximately 92.64% with the default configuration `(RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42))`. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters, the model’s performance improved slightly to 92.71%, though this enhancement came with a noticeable increase in computation time.
