## Introduction
Provide a brief introduction to the project, its purpose, and what you aim to achieve.

## Notes
The Random Forest model delivered the most accurate predictions for property prices, achieving an R² score of approximately 92.64% with the default configuration (RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)). By fine-tuning the hyperparameters, the model’s performance improved slightly to 92.71%, though this enhancement came with a noticeable increase in computation time.
